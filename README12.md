# Welcome to Sharebox!

Sharebox is a Dropbox-like Sharing App using Ruby on Rails. All credits go to Phyo Wai who authored the original [tutorial](http://www.prowl.in/sharebox.html) that I followed in developing this app. The only deviations from the original content were minor ones to fix bugs or oversights (such as securing the homepage). Since it seems that the original site may be down for good, I thought I'd post the resulting code online for anyone else to use.

Happy Sharing!<br/>
